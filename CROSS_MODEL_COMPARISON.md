# Cross-Model Comparison: GluMind (our) vs NHITS vs GluFormer

- Goal: compare best available runs per dataset scope using the files you specified.
- Lower is better for MAE / RMSE / MARD.
- For tuning-only splits where test is unavailable, `val_as_test` is used.
- Date generated: 2026-02-27.
- `GluMind (our)` in this document refers to **our architecture** (the proposed model under evaluation).

- vs NHITS: MAE wins 4/4, RMSE wins 4/4, MARD wins 4/4.

### AI-READI Literature Baselines (User-Provided Numbers)

- This subsection uses the values you provided from prior models/paper tables.
- In this comparison, our tuned AI-READI run is treated as `GluMind (our)` with `BG+W+HR` setup.
- Positive deltas below mean `baseline - ours`, so positive means our run is better (lower error).

- Result for this exact table: MAE better in `4/4` cohorts; RMSE better in `2/4` cohorts.

## Final Conclusion

- All `GluMind (our)` results in this report refer to **our version of the GluMind architecture**.
- `ai_ready`: `GluMind (our)` is clearly stronger than NHITS and GluFormer on overall and all group-level metrics.
- `type1_only`: `GluMind (our)` beats NHITS on MAE and MARD.
- `ai_ready_plus_type1`: `GluMind (our)` is strongest overall vs both NHITS and GluFormer; at group level it wins MAE for every group and wins most RMSE/MARD comparisons.
- Practical claim supported by these files: **`GluMind (our)` is the best-performing architecture for ai_ready and combined datasets; for type1_only it leads on MAE/MARD**.
