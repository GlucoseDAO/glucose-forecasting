# T1DM Covariate Ablation Report — SugarOne on Loop Test Data

**Date:** 2026-06-13  
**Evaluation tool:** `uv run evaluate-model` (`src/sugar_one/evaluate_model.py`)  
**Model checkpoint:** `runs/sugar_one_tune/production/trial_0000_bcd3813f` (`best_model.pt`)  
**Test dataset:** `data/loop_and_ai_ready/ablation_test.csv`  
**Scaler fitting:** `data/loop_and_ai_ready/loop_ai_ready_joined2.csv` (train split)

## Executive summary

Eight inference configurations were run on a **T1DM-only, covariate-complete loop test subset** (819,013 sliding windows). Using **all three insulin/carb covariates** yields the best MAE (**13.08 mg/dL**). Removing all covariates (`--zero-cov`) degrades MAE by **+0.47 mg/dL (+3.6%)**.

**Bolus insulin** is the strongest single channel: `--include-cov bolus` alone reaches MAE **13.22** (within **0.14 mg/dL** of full covariates), and `--exclude-cov bolus` causes the largest single-channel drop (**+0.32 mg/dL**). **Basal rate** contributes the least marginally (**+0.03 mg/dL** when excluded). **Carbohydrates** sit in between for both single-channel and exclusion tests.

## Dataset statistics

`ablation_test.csv` was extracted from `loop_ai_ready_joined2.csv` with:

- `Recommended Split == test`
- `Study Group == T1DM`
- Quality filter: every sequence for each user has basal, bolus, and carb values present on at least one row

| Metric | Value |
|--------|------:|
| Rows | 937,989 |
| Users | 9 |
| Sequences | 861 |
| Evaluation windows (128 input + 12 horizon) | 819,013 |
| Study groups | T1DM only |
| Time span | 2017-11-26 → 2020-01-11 |

### Glucose distribution

| Statistic | mg/dL |
|-----------|------:|
| Min | 39.0 |
| Median | 114.0 |
| Mean | 124.7 |
| Max | 401.0 |

### Event types

| Event Type | Rows | Share |
|------------|-----:|------:|
| EGV | 763,481 | 81.4% |
| Interpolated | 174,436 | 18.6% |
| BGM | 72 | <0.1% |

### Covariate fill rates (non-empty raw values)

Covariates are sparse at the row level (pump events vs continuous EGV), but imputation (basal forward-fill; bolus/carbs event-only) propagates signals into sliding windows.

| Covariate | Filled rows | Share of rows |
|-----------|------------:|--------------:|
| Basal rate | 345,084 | 36.8% |
| Bolus insulin | 37,660 | 4.0% |
| Carbohydrates | 21,559 | 2.3% |
| All three on same row | 2,705 | 0.3% |

### Benchmark alignment

The full-covariate run on this file (MAE **13.08**, 819,013 windows) matches the saved **T1DM study-group** metrics from the same checkpoint on the full joined2 test split (MAE **13.09**, 819,013 windows in `docs/GLUMIND_VS_SUGARONE_COMPARISON.md`). This confirms `ablation_test.csv` is the loop/T1DM portion of the joined benchmark test set.

### Configurations (8 runs)

| # | Label | CLI flags | Active covariates |

### Marginal contribution (exclude-one analysis)

Effect of removing a single covariate while keeping the other two:

| Removed covariate | MAE after removal | Δ MAE vs All | Relative importance |
|-------------------|------------------:|-------------:|--------------------:|
| Basal | 13.109 | **+0.030** | Low |
| Carbs | 13.218 | +0.140 | Medium |
| Bolus | 13.400 | **+0.321** | **High** |

### Single-covariate sufficiency (include-one analysis)

Effect of keeping only one covariate (others zeroed):

| Only covariate kept | MAE | Δ MAE vs None | Δ MAE vs All |
|---------------------|----:|--------------:|-------------:|
| Bolus | **13.216** | **−0.329** | +0.138 |
| Basal | 13.402 | −0.144 | +0.323 |
| Carbs | 13.501 | −0.045 | +0.423 |

Bolus alone recovers **~70%** of the gain from using all covariates (0.33 mg/dL of the 0.47 mg/dL gap between None and All).

### RMSE vs MAE

RMSE spreads are larger than MAE spreads (e.g. All → None: **+0.85 RMSE** vs **+0.47 MAE**). Covariates reduce **large errors** disproportionately — consistent with bolus/carbs capturing meal and correction spikes that glucose history alone misses.

---

## Conclusions

1. **Covariates help on T1DM loop data.** Full covariates beat glucose-only by **0.47 mg/dL MAE (~3.6%)** and **0.85 mg/dL RMSE (~4.3%)** on this test set. The effect is larger than the ~0.23 mg/dL average gain on the **mixed** joined2 test split (loop + ai_ready), because every row here comes from pump-enriched loop traces.

2. **Bolus is the dominant channel.** It has the highest marginal value when excluded (+0.32 MAE) and performs best as a single channel (13.22 MAE). This aligns with bolus events marking intentional insulin delivery tied to near-future glucose dynamics, despite appearing on only **4%** of raw rows.

3. **Basal contributes least at the margin.** Excluding basal barely changes MAE (+0.03 mg/dL). Basal is more continuous (37% row fill, forward-filled across windows) and may be partially redundant with recent glucose trend after imputation — or its effect is spread thin compared to discrete bolus pulses.

4. **Carbs are useful but sparse.** Excluding carbs costs +0.14 MAE; carbs-only is the weakest single channel (+0.42 MAE vs All). Carb entries are rare (2.3% of rows) but still add information beyond bolus alone (Exclude carbs vs Exclude basal: +0.11 MAE difference).

5. **Include-one ≠ exclude-one symmetry.** `--include-cov bolus` (13.22) is much better than `--exclude-cov bolus` (13.40) relative to All (13.08). Single-channel modes discard complementary information; the model was trained with all channels present, so asymmetric degradation is expected.

6. **Practical implication.** For deployment on pump/CGM data where carb logging is unreliable, **basal + bolus** (Exclude carbs, MAE 13.22) is nearly as good as the full model (13.08). Prioritize bolus signal quality over carbs when sensor bandwidth or documentation is limited.

## Limitations and caveats

- **Same checkpoint, perturbed inputs only.** We ablate covariates at inference time; the model was trained with all channels. Retraining with matched covariate subsets could change relative rankings.
- **Not additive.** Marginal Δ MAE values from exclude-one tests do not sum to the total All vs None gap because channels interact non-linearly in the transformer.
- **Scaler fitting unchanged.** MinMax scalers always use full training covariates; ablated channels are zeroed after imputation, not re-scaled.
- **T1DM loop users only.** Results do not generalize to ai_ready wearable cohorts where insulin columns are empty.
- **Interpolated rows included.** ~18.6% of rows are `Interpolated` events; metadata `drop_interpolated` is false for this checkpoint.
